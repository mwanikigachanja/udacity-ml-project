Domain Expert Language Model â€“ Fine-Tuning with Meta Llama 2 7B
A Project by Charles Mwaniki | Certificate in Introducing Generative AI with AWS (Udacity)

Overview
This project explores the creation of a domain expert model to enhance customer experience and streamline information delivery. By fine-tuning the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model using AWS SageMaker, the goal is to develop a language model specialized in generating accurate and contextually relevant text for a specific domain. The project simulates the work of an AI engineer tasked with solving real-world business challenges.

Objective
The purpose of this project is to:

Fine-tune a large language model for a chosen domain (Finance, Medical, or IT).
Adapt the model to generate domain-specific, accurate, and reliable text for applications such as chatbots, knowledge management systems, or content generation tools.
Features
Model Used: Meta Llama 2 7B (pre-trained for general text-generation tasks).
AWS Tools Utilized: Amazon SageMaker for deployment, fine-tuning, and testing.
Deliverables: A domain-specific trained model, evaluation report, and project documentation.
Budget Constraint: The total AWS resource cost is capped at $25.
Project Implementation
1. Dataset Preparation
Selection: Choose a copyright-free, unstructured text dataset for the chosen domain.
Cleaning & Preprocessing: Ensure the dataset is relevant, formatted, and ready for fine-tuning tasks.
2. SageMaker Resource Configuration
Launch AWS SageMaker Jupyter Notebook instance.
Configure SageMaker resources for cost efficiency:
Stop instances when idle.
Delete unused model resources.
3. Model Deployment & Testing
Deploy: Use the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model via SageMaker.
Test Initial Model: Evaluate its response to domain-specific tasks (knowledge queries, text generation).
4. Fine-Tuning
Fine-Tuning Setup: Adapt the model to the dataset using SageMaker training jobs.
Training: Leverage the dataset to specialize the model for domain knowledge.
Evaluation: Compare pre- and post-training performance on domain-specific tasks.
5. Deployment of Fine-Tuned Model
Deployment: Host the fine-tuned model as a SageMaker endpoint.
Testing: Evaluate its performance for:
Accuracy in domain-specific knowledge queries.
Contextual relevance in text generation.
Deliverables
Fine-Tuned Model: A domain-specific Meta Llama 2 7B model.
Evaluation Report: Documenting process, challenges, and solutions.
GitHub Repository: Codebase, dataset, and documentation for reproducibility.
Challenges Encountered
Dataset selection and preprocessing to ensure domain relevance.
Cost optimization under a $25 AWS budget.
Balancing model performance with resource constraints.
