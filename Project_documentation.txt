Project Documentation Report
Project Name: Introducing Generative AI with AWS
GitHub Repository: udacity-ml-project

1. Pre-trained Model Evaluation
1.1 Deployment of Pre-trained Model on AWS SageMaker
Successfully deployed the Llama2 7B pre-trained model on AWS SageMaker.
Proof of Deployment: Screenshots of the SageMaker console showing the deployed model and the endpoint status are included in the img folder.

Evaluated the model for its ability to generate domain-specific IT-related text using Model_Evaluation.ipynb.
1.2 Evaluation of Pre-trained Model
The evaluation involved testing the pre-trained model's ability to handle domain-specific inputs, including IT terminologies and scenarios.
Observations from Evaluation:
Responses were generic and lacked depth in IT-specific areas such as system administration and cloud technologies.
Demonstrated strong capabilities in text coherence and structure, but contextual relevance required improvement.
Proof of Completion: Model evaluation notebook with output cells has been uploaded to the GitHub repository.
2. Fine-tuning a Large Language Model
2.1 Fine-tuning Process
Fine-tuned the Llama2 7B model using a carefully curated dataset specific to the IT domain.
Dataset Details:
Comprised technical guides, programming references, and IT system administration content.
Stored in an AWS S3 bucket created for the project. Screenshots of the S3 bucket configuration are included in the repository.
Proof of Fine-tuning:
Model_FineTuning.ipynb notebook contains detailed steps of the fine-tuning process, including dataset loading, hyperparameter tuning, and model optimization.
Screenshots of fine-tuning cell outputs are available for verification.
2.2 Challenges and Resolutions
Challenge: Managing costs within the $25 AWS budget.
Solution: Efficiently used SageMaker resources by terminating unused endpoints and minimizing idle time during processing.
3. Evaluation of Fine-tuned Model
3.1 Deployment of Fine-tuned Model
Deployed the fine-tuned model on AWS SageMaker for testing its improved performance.
Proof of Deployment: Screenshots of the deployment process and model status in the SageMaker console.
3.2 Evaluation of Fine-tuned Model
Evaluated the fine-tuned model's ability to respond to IT-specific queries and generate relevant, contextually accurate text.
Results:
Demonstrated a significant improvement in understanding IT-related prompts.
Provided detailed and accurate responses for topics such as server management, cloud computing, and debugging techniques.
Comparison with Pre-trained Model: The fine-tuned model significantly outperformed the pre-trained version in domain-specific text generation tasks.
