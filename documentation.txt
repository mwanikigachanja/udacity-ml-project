Project Documentation Report
Project Name: Domain-Specific Language Model with AWS
GitHub Repository: udacity-ml-project

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a domain-specific large language model (LLM) capable of generating contextually relevant and accurate responses within the IT domain. The model leverages Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model, fine-tuned using AWS SageMaker. By adapting the model to IT-specific datasets, this project seeks to demonstrate the capabilities of generative AI in solving real-world business challenges, such as creating chatbots, knowledge management systems, and content generation tools.

Steps Completed
1. Dataset Selection
Chosen Domain: IT domain
Dataset Description: The IT dataset includes unstructured text comprising technical documentation, system admin guides, programming references, and IT troubleshooting resources.
Key Considerations:
The dataset was copyright-free and relevant to the IT field.
Focused on covering key IT concepts such as server management, networking, and cloud computing.
2. Model Deployment and Evaluation (Pre-Fine-Tuning)
Steps Taken:

Deployed Meta Llama 2 7B on AWS SageMaker using Model_Evaluation.ipynb.
Tested the model's responses to IT-specific prompts (e.g., cloud computing concepts, debugging techniques).
Evaluation Observations:

The model provided generic responses, lacking depth in IT-specific queries.
Showed potential but required fine-tuning for domain-specific expertise.
Proof: Screenshot of the notebook with cell output uploaded to the GitHub repository.

3. Model Fine-Tuning
Steps Taken:

Fine-tuned Meta Llama 2 7B using the IT dataset on AWS SageMaker (Model_FineTuning.ipynb).
Verified the fine-tuned model's weights in the assigned S3 bucket.
Challenges:

Managing AWS resource costs ($25 budget).
Optimizing the fine-tuning process to ensure meaningful improvements without overfitting.
Proof:

Fine-tuning notebook with cell output and S3 bucket screenshot uploaded to the GitHub repository.
4. Deploy and Evaluate Fine-Tuned Model
Steps Taken:

Deployed the fine-tuned model and tested its ability to respond to IT-specific queries.
Evaluated responses for accuracy, relevance, and depth.
Evaluation Observations:

The fine-tuned model demonstrated significant improvements, providing accurate, detailed, and contextually relevant responses.
Suitable for applications like chatbots and knowledge management systems in the IT sector.
Proof: Screenshot of deployment and evaluation notebook (Model_FineTuning.ipynb) with outputs included in the GitHub repository.

Project Deliverables
Trained Model: Fine-tuned Meta Llama 2 7B for the IT domain.
Jupyter Notebooks:

Screenshots: Documenting key milestones (e.g., dataset upload, model deployment, evaluation results).
S3 Bucket Proof: Verified fine-tuned model weights stored securely.
GitHub Repository: Comprehensive codebase and documentation available here.
Challenges and Solutions
1. Budget Constraints
Challenge: Limited AWS budget of $25.
Solution:
Ensured efficient resource usage by stopping and deleting unused instances.
Carefully planned model deployment and fine-tuning sessions.
2. Dataset Preparation
Challenge: Curating a comprehensive IT dataset.
Solution: Sourced high-quality, copyright-free materials relevant to IT topics.
Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the ability to fine-tune a large language model for domain-specific tasks. The fine-tuned Meta Llama 2 7B model excelled in IT-related queries, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.

This project serves as a testament to the power of generative AI and AWS tools in solving business challenges. It also highlights my proficiency in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud-based AI solutions.
